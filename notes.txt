General Notes
- Similar timestamps probably means the tweets during livestream are talking about same award/person/event
- Use IMDB API for validations (double check with professor)
- Maybe use tweet images to see whether they are similar
- Partition tweets into three: during livestream, before livestream, after livestream
  - Find out roughly how long each announcement/award section is to figure out which tweets during livestream relate to which award
